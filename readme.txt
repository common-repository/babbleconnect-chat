BabbleConnect magically places a real-time widget on your site, connecting you to your site visiors
via text message.

== Description ==

[BabbleConnect](https://babbleconnect.com/) enables real-time chat on your web site via text messaging.

Our vision is to use tools you already have (like Wordpress and SMS text messages) to grant small businesses
the ability to provide big-business service and accessibility using smart technology solutions.

It's a fact that sites without real-time chat suffer from less engagement by website visitors. 98% of new
visitors leave without doing anything! BabbleConnect chat can help change that: meaning more engagement,
more conversions, more insight, and more sales.

Often, you don't need more traffic to close more sales. You just need to talk to visitors when they're
live on your site.  Help customers who have questions, encourage them to use your services, and get critical
feedback -- in real-time, using the built-in text messaging on your phone.

= Live Chat With Your Customers =
Half of your web visitors leave after just 15 seconds. Live real-time chat helps you keep & convert more visitors.

= Improve Your Net Promoter Score =
Get actionable feedback that will help improve your referral base and deepen existing relationships.

= Features =

**Capture email addresses.**
Get email addresses right inside of BabbleConnect's live chat so you can follow up later.

**Key Features**

* Talk to your website visitors and customers in real-time via Text Messages (SMS).
* Customize the data gathered from anonymous visitors before initiating a new chat conversation, i.e., email or phone, either optional or required.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is BabbleConnect free? =

The BabbleConnect Chat tools are free to try. New Wordpress users are automatically enrolled into our "pay as you go" plan and
given some free credits to get started. Upgrade options are available once you find our services of value.

= What does BabbleConnect let me do? =

BabbleConnect adds a chat tool to your site which visitors can use to engage with you via text message.
You can use it to collect feedback, learn about your visitors, build relationships with new clients, and close more deals.

= Do I have to install any software to get this working? =

Well, this plugin :-). But generally, no. BabbleConnect is a hosted live chat service. Simply configure the plugin and you're done!

In fact, a chat "client" is not necessary either. Our philosophy is to integrate with tools you already use to facilitate conversations.
BabbleConnect sends messages to and from your phone (or phones, if you have help) via SMS Text Messaging. Visitors to your site
communicate with you in real-time via text message.

= Which web browsers work best with this plugin =

BabbleConnect is intended for use on modern browsers. If you're using a browser released after 2015 or so, you'll be fine.
The same goes for visitors to your site. But don't worry -- if we encounter an old browser, we simply won't present the
BabbleConnect chat widget. It's like it isn't installed for folks still using Windows 95 -- there are no strange errors or
any other negative consequences.

= Is it free to use? =

The plugin comes with a free starter plan for WordPress users. Larger businesses can purchase upgrade options anytime.

After enabling the plugin, use the BabbleConnect Administration Tools to customize your widget, e.g., integrate its look and feel to match your site.
